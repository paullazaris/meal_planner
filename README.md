Meal planner for new ideas and recipes 
The idea is to have user input do tell the program thier budget and what types of cuisine they would like to make. I would like to have options for salads and side dishes. I would like to include separate dictionaries for types of cuisine (i.e. Italian, Mexican, American, Asian, etc.) to narrow down the results and a .pop() method so recipies aren't repeated. LEGO!
